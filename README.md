**📚 Main Logic Explained**

The core logic of this password generator lies in the generatePassword function. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

**Character Sets:**

The function starts by defining various character sets: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.

**Combine Characters:**

Depending on your selections (checkboxes), it combines these character sets into a single allChars string.

**Random Selection:**

For each character in the password (based on the desired length), a random index is picked from allChars.

**Build Password:**

The selected characters are concatenated to form the final password, which is then displayed on the screen.

**🔧 Technologies Used**

**Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

**JavaScript:** Logic and interaction.

**HTML & CSS:** Structure and styling.
